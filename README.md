Debouncing is a technique in programming that helps prevent time-consuming tasks from being triggered so frequently that they slow down the performance of a web page.

Concept: Debouncing delays the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last event trigger. If another event occurs within that time, the timer resets.

Use Cases:
Search input suggestions: Only send API requests when the user stops typing.
Window resize event: Only recalculate layout after the user finishes resizing.
